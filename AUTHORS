Most of pdnsd was written by Thomas Moestl (tmoestl@gmx.net).

Small parts of this program are based on code that  was taken from nmap (IP 
checksumming), the isdn4k-utils (ippp interface uptest) and glibc 2.1.2 (some
definitions for kernel 2.2.x missing in 2.0 glibcs).
nmap was written by Fyodor. The insd4k-utils were written by Fritz Elfert and
others. The GNU C library (glibc) is copyright by the Free Software 
Foundation.

The following people have contributed code:
Torben Janssen		contributed RedHat rc scripts
Sourav K. Mandal	contributed the autoconf/automake code, gdbm
			caching facility and many suggestions
Markus Mohr		contributed Debian rc scripts
Wolfgang Ocker		contributed the server_ip option
Soenke J. Peters	contributed patches and suggestions for RedHat 
			compatability
Lyonel Vincent		extended the serve_aliases option to support an
			arbitrary number of aliases
Nikita V. Youschenko	contributed extensions to the "if" uptest


Please look into the THANKS file for people who helped me in various ways on
this project.
