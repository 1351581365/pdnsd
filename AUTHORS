Small parts of this program are based on code that  was taken from nmap (IP 
checksumming) and the isdn4k-utils (ippp interface uptest).
nmap was written by Fyodor. The insd4k-utils were written by Fritz Elfert and
others.

Torben Janssen contributed the files in rc/Redhat.
Soeren J. Peters contributed patches and suggestions for Red Hat compatability.

Thanks to Byrial Jensen, Fraser McCrossan, Joachim Dorner, Alan Swanson and
Bert Frederiks for reporting bugs!
