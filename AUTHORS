pdnsd was written by Thomas Moestl (tmoestl@gmx.net)

Small parts of this program are based on code that  was taken from nmap (IP 
checksumming) and the isdn4k-utils (ippp interface uptest).
nmap was written by Fyodor. The insd4k-utils were written by Fritz Elfert and
others.

Torben Janssen contributed the files in rc/Redhat.
Soenke J. Peters contributed patches and suggestions for Red Hat compatability.

Please look into the THANKS file for people who helped me in various ways on
this project.
