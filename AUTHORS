pdnsd was written by Thomas Moestl (tmoestl@gmx.net)

Small parts of this program are based on code that  was taken from nmap (IP 
checksumming) and the isdn4k-utils (ippp interface uptest).
nmap was written by Fyodor. The insd4k-utils were written by Fritz Elfert and
others.

Torben Janssen contributed the files in rc/Redhat.
Soeren J. Peters contributed patches and suggestions for Red Hat compatability.

Thanks to Byrial Jensen, Fraser McCrossan, Joachim Dorner, Alan Swanson,
Bert Frederiks, Jonathan Hudson and Daniel Smolik for reporting bugs!
