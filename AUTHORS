pdnsd was written by Thomas Moestl (tmoestl@gmx.net)

Small parts of this program are based on code that  was taken from nmap (IP 
checksumming), the isdn4k-utils (ippp interface uptest) and glibc 2.1.2 (some
definitions for kernel 2.2.x missing in 2.0 glibcs).
nmap was written by Fyodor. The insd4k-utils were written by Fritz Elfert and
others. The GNU C library (glibc) is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation.

Torben Janssen contributed the files in rc/Redhat.
Soenke J. Peters contributed patches and suggestions for Red Hat compatability.
Wolfgang Ocker has contributed the code for the server_ip option.
Markus Mohr has contributed the files in rc/Debian.

Please look into the THANKS file for people who helped me in various ways on
this project.
