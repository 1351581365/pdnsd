Owner and ttl are used as in the source section. ttl has a default
of 900 (it does not need to be specified). The last option corresponds
to the serve_aliases option, and is off by default. fn is the filename.

\fBadd\fR
cname host name [ttl]

Add a record of the given type to the pdnsd cache, replacing existing
records for the same name and type. The 2nd argument corresponds
to the argument of the option in the rr section that is named like
the first option. The ttl is optional, the default is 900 seconds.
If you want no other record than the newly added in the cache, do
pdnsd-ctl record <name> delete
before adding records.

print pdnsd's status
.TP
\fBneg\fR
name [type] [ttl]

Add a negative cached record to pdnsd's cache, replacing existing

domain is cached negative. For negative cached records, errors are
immediately returned on a query, without querying other servers first.
The ttl is optional, the default is 900 seconds.
.TP
\fBlist-rrtypes\fR
[no options]

List available rr types for the neg command. Note that those are only
used for the neg command, not for add!
