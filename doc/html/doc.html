    <center><h1>pdnsd Documentation</h1></center>
    This is the &quot;official&quot; pdnsd documentation and reference.<br>
    It is up-to-date for version 1.1.0b1. For older documentation, please refer to the doc
    directory of the respective pdnsd package.<br>
    A pdnsd HOWTO (&quot;unofficial&quot; step-by-step installation and setup instructions)
    is available at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sunil_tt/">http://www.geocities.com/sunil_tt/</a>.
    

    <h2>0. Installation</h2>
    <h3>0.1 Installing binary RPM's</h3>
    To install a binary RPM, just do<br>
    <code>rpm -i pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.rpm</code><br>
    This should install pretty much everything automatically. The only thing left
    for you to do is adatpt your configuration file (stored in <code>/etc/pdnsd.conf</code>)
    according to your needs (see below). 
    In the SuSE RPMs, a start script is also installed; read the section <i>0.4, Start at Boot Time</i>
    about that.

    <br>
    <h3>0.2 Installing source RPM's</h3>
    To install a source RPM, just do<br>
    <code>rpm --recompile pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.rpm</code><br>
    This should install pretty much everything automatically. The only thing left
    for you to do is adapt your configuration file (stored in <code>/etc/pdnsd.conf</code>)
    according to your needs. 
    In the SuSE RPMs, a start script is also installed; read the section <i>Start at Boot Time</i>
    about that.

    <br>
    <h3>0.3 Installing from the pure sources (tar archives)</h3>
    <h4>0.3.1 Decompressing</h4>
    pdsnsd comes in two different packed archives: the standard gzip'ed version
    pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz, and the bzip2-packed version (about 10% smaller)
    pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2. If you have bunzip2 installed on your computer, I 
    recommed you save bandwidth and get the .bz2-version.
    To decompress it (using a modern tar) do<br>
    <code>tar -xzf pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</code><br>
    <i>--or--</i><br>
    <code>tar -xIf pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2</code><br><br>
    If your tar doesn't do this, use:<br>
    <code>gunzip pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz<br>
      tar -xf pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar</code><br>
    <i>--or--</i><br>
    <code>bunzip2 pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar.bz2<br>
      tar -xf pdnsd-&lt;version&gt;.tar</code>


    <br>
    <h4>0.3.2 Setup </h4>
    Change into the pdnsd source directory and run configure. It takes the following command line
    options (if you do not specify an option, defaults will be used):<br>
    <table bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=10>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--prefix=dir</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify the prefix directory. The pdnsd files are installed in subdirectories
	  of the prefix, the pdnsd and pdnsd-ctl executables are for example installed
	  in the sbin subdirectory of the prefix. The default for this is /usr/local;
	  you might want to set this to /usr (using <code>--prefix=/usr</code>).
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--sysconfdir=dir</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify the config directory. pdnsd expects its pdnsd.conf file to reside
	  there if the <code>-c</code> option is not given at startup.
	  The default for this is the <code>etc</code> subdirectory of your prefix, e.g. <code>/usr/local/etc</code>
	  if you did not specify a prefix. To set this e.g. to <code>/etc<code>, use <code>--sysconfdir=/etc</code>.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-distribution=distro</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify target distribution (default=Generic; others: RedHat, SuSE, Debian)<br>
	  See below for the effect of these settings.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-target=platform</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Change compilation target platform (default: autodetect; others: Linux, BSD)<br>
	  autodetect will attempt to detect whether you are using *BSD or Linux and
	  should normally be sufficient. If this does not work, try specifyning
	  you system manually.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-cachedir=dir</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Default directory for pdnsd cache (default=/var/cache/pdnsd)<br>
	  This setting can be changed via config file settings when pdnsd was built.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-dbm=dbm</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specifiy database manager to use for cacheing (default=native; others: gdbm)<br>
	  Currently, only native will work.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-isdn</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enable ISDN support<br>
	  This option will work only on Linux and may cause problems with 2.0.x or
	  old 2.2.x kernels. You will need it for a proper <code>if</code> uptest
	  under Linux for ISDN ppp devices.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-ipv4</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable IPv4 networking support (default=enabled)
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-ipv6</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enable IPv6 networking support.<br>
	  If your OS does support IPv6 properly, you should be able to serve also
	  IPv4 queries using this. Normally, this is disabled and you won't need
	  it.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-ipv4-startup</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable IPv4 on pdnsd startup by default (default=enabled)
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-ipv6-startup</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enable IPV6 on pdnsd startup by default (default=IPv4).
	  These options are only defaults, you can specify on
	  the command line or in the config files which IP version
	  will really be used.
	  Normally, you won't need to change these.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-udp-queries</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable udp as query method. You shouldn't need to change
	  this.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-tcp-queries </code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enable the TCP as query method. This is seldom needed in normal usage.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-query-method=qm</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify the query method (default=udponly, others: tcpudp, tcponly)
	  If you have enabled both udp and tcp queries, this lets you control
	  which query method pdnsd will use ny default. tcpudp will try tcp
	  first and back out to udp if tcp is not supported by the server;
	  udponly and tcponly should be clear.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-tcp-server</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable tcp server. This may cause problems with very large answers.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-src-addr-disc</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable the UDP source address discovery.<br>
	  You need this only if you have trouble with messages saying 
	  &quot;could not discover udp source address&quot;.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-poll</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable poll(2) and use select(2) (default=enabled)<br>
	  You will normally not need this.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--disable-new-rrs</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Disable new DNS RR types. This may cause problems with some resolvers.
	  The new types are RP, AFSDB, X25, ISDN, RT,  NSAP,
	  PX, GPOS, AAAA, LOC, EID, NIMLOC, SRV, ATMA, NAPTR and KX.
	  Most of these are seldomly needed, but AAAA is essential
	  when using IPv6.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-strict-rfc2181</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enforce strict RFC 2181 compliance.<br>
	  This will cause pdnsd to reject DNS answers with incorrect
	  timestamp settings (multiple RRs of the same type and for the same domain with
	  different TTLs). Normally not needed.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-underscores</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Allow underscores (_) in domain names. This breaks RFC compliance, but some
	  sites use it for historical reasons because BIND used to support it.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-random-device=device</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify random device; default: C Library <code>random()</code> PRNG<br>
	  pdnsd uses (pseudo-)  random numbers as query IDs for security reasons
	  (this makes forging DNS answers more difficult). This option
	  controls where pdnsd gets these from. The default is the C library
	  <code>random()</code> function, which is relatively weak.
	  You can specify a device like /dev/urandom here if you like; pdnsd will read
	  random numbers  from it 16-bit-wise. /dev/urandom is present under Linux and
	  most BSD derivates. You should not use /dev/random - it is more secure, but
	  may block and delay pdnsd's answers for a long time.<br>
	  You can specify <code>arc4random</code> to use the BSD <code>arc4random()</code>
	  library function (default for FreeBSD target), which is considered safe.<br>
	  You can also specify <code>random</code> as device to use the C Library
	  <code>random()</code> function (described above).
	  
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-default-id=user </code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify default user for pdnsd (default=nobody).
	  This is the user that will be entered for the <code>run_as</code>
	  option in the config file (see below) that will be installed during <code>make install</code>.
	  You can change this any time in your config file.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-debug=level</code>
	</td>
	<td>
          Specify debugging level. Debug output will only be generated if you turn on special
	  switches; it might be useful for debugginh your config files, so I recommend
	  using the default (9).
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-verbosity=level</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify default message verbosity. The default should be ok.

      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-rcsids    </code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enable RCS IDs in executables (default=disabled).<br>
	  For personal use, there is no need to do this. If you build rpm's, it
	  might have advantages.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--enable-tcp-subseq</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Enable subsequent tcp queries. The DNS protocol standard
	  requires that servers must be capable of answering multiple
	  subsequent queries that are sent over the same tcp connection, and that
	  the server may only close the connection by himself after a certain
	  timeout. This feature is rarely used, but may make denial-of-service
	  attacks easier, as it allows for an attacker to hold a connection open
	  a long time (although the attacker's IP is most likely revealed then).
	  For full standard compliance, you should use this option.
	  If you do not use <code>--enable-tcp-server</code>, is option is not honored.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-tcp-qtimeout</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify default tcp query timeout after which the connection is closed
	  if no full query has been received. The default is 30s.
	  You can also change this option at run time using th tcp_qtimeout
	  config file option.
	  If you do not use <code>--enable-tcp-server</code>, is option is not honored.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <code>--with-par-queries</code>
	</td>
	<td>
	  Specify the default number of queries that can be executed in parallel.
	  You can also change this option at run time using th par_queries
	  config file option. See the description of that option for an explanation
	  of what it really does.<br>
	  The default for this option is 2.
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Normally, you will need only <code>--prefix</code>, <code>--sysconfdir</code> and 
    <code>--with-distribution</code>.
    If you specify your distribution using <code>--with-distribution</code>, this has the
    following effects:
    <ul>
      <li> An rc script is copied in the appropriate localtion, which enables pdnsd to start
	at machine boot time (see 0.4)
      <li> Distribution-specific portions might be included in the generated pdnsd.spec
	file (only important if you want to build rpm archives yourself).
    </ul>
    If you choose <code>Generic</code>, no rc script is installled, and a generic spec
    file is generated.<br>

    Further instructions are in the INSTALL document in the pdsd source directory.
    <code>./configure --help</code> will give you a list of all supported command line
    options.
    
    <br>
    <h4>0.3.3 Building &amp; installing </h4>
    Type <code>make</code> in the source directory. <i>Should</i> work by now.<br>
    To install, type <code>make install</code> or do the installation by hand (see <i>0.3.4</i>).<br>
    <code>make install</code> will do the following ($prefix is the prefix directory; see above):<br>
    <ol>
      <li> copies pdnsd to <code>$(prefix)/sbin/</code>
      <li> copies pdnsd-ctl to <code>$(prefix)/sbin/</code>
      <li> copies docs/pdnsd.conf.sample (a sample configuration) to the pdnsd config directory.
      <li> creates your cache directory if it is not there.
	After installation, you should check the file permissions and create or edit 
	<code>/etc/pdnsd.conf</code> to fit your needs (see below).
	If you use the <code>run_as</code> option, please make sure that your cache directory is owned by
	the user you specified with this option!
    </ol>
    You must be root for this installation!<br>
    <b>Security notes:</b> <b><i>never</i></b> make the pdnsd cache directory 
    writeable for untrusted users, or you will get several security holes: 
    the users might modify the cache contents, or plant dangerous links.<br>
    If you use a pidfile, you should be aware that you introduce security
    problems if you place the pidfile in a directory in a NFS filesystem that
    is writeable for untrusted users. Generally, the pidfile directory 
    (typically /var/run) should not be writeable for untrusted users.
    <br>
    <h4>0.3.4 Manual installation </h4>
    For a manual installation, you need to do the following steps:
    <ol>
      <li> Copy pdnsd and pdnsd-ctl from your build directory to an appropriate location (e.g. <code>/usr/sbin</code>).
      <li> Copy <code>docs/pdnsd.conf</code> into the directory you want it to reside (<code>/etc</code> by default, 
	    and change it according to your needs (see below).
      <li> Create your caching directory; default is <code>/var/cache/pdnsd</code> (you may change this
	in your <code>pdnsd.conf</code>); Permisions should be at max <code>rwxr-xr-x</code> (if you want to
	protect your cache and status socket, make it <code>rwx------</code>).
    </ol>
    Thats it! 
    <br>

    <h3>0.4 Start at boot time</h3>
    In the <code>rc</code> folder of the pdnsd distribution are start scripts
    for pdnsd designed for different Linux distros. There are scripts
    for SuSE  and Redhat Linux now.<br>
    The start scripts are automatically installed during RPM install, and also during <code>make install</code>
    if you specified your distro.
    <h4>0.4.1 SuSE Linux startup</h4>
    <code>rc/SuSE/pdnsd</code> is a start script for SuSE Linux. It was tested for 6.? but should run on some
    versions below. You can do <code>make install</code> as root in the <code>rc/SuSE</code> 
    directory to install it, or you can install manually:<br>
    <table width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=5>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b>manual installation</b>
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  For manual installation, copy <code>rc/SuSE/pdnsd</code> into <code>/sbin/init.d/</code>, go to
	  <code>/sbin/init.d/rc2.d/</code> and create there the following two symlinks:<br>
	  S11pdnsd to ../pdnsd (do <code>ln -s ../pdnsd S11pdnsd</code> in that dir) <br>
	  K34pdnsd to ../pdnsd (do <code>ln -s ../pdnsd K34pdnsd</code> in that dir) <br>
	  The numbers dictate the order different services are started and 
	  might need to be modified. Then edit your <code>/etc/rc.config</code> file and
	  add the line <code>START_PDNSD=yes</code> to start pdnsd at boot time.
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      If you used the <code>make install</code> command, <code>START_PDNSD=yes</code> has been
      appended to your <code>/etc/rc.config</code> file, causing pdnsd to be started
      at boot time. If you don't want that, change the <code>yes</code> into <code>no</code>.
    </p>
    This start script was created from <code>/sbin/init.d/skeleton</code> by me, so the
    most is copyrighted by SuSE. They put it under the GPL, however, so
    the license stated in <a href="COPYING">COPYING</a> also applies to this script.
    There is NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND on these scripts.
    This is no official SuSE script, and SuSE naturally does NO support 
    for it.
    <h4>0.4.2 Red Hat Linux startup</h4>
    <code>rc/Redhat/pdnsd</code> is a start script for Red Hat Linux. It was contibuted by Torben
    Janssen. <br>
    This was tested for 6.1 but should run on 5.0+. You can do <code>make install</code> as root in the 
    <code>rc/Redhat</code> directory to install it, or you can install manually:<br>
    <table width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=5>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b>manual installation</b>
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  For manual installation, copy <code>rc/Redhat/pdnsd</code> into <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/</code><br>
	  Then go to <code>/etc/rc.d/rc3.d</code> and create there the following symlink:<br>
	  S78pdnsd -> ../init.d/pdnsd 
	  (do <code>ln -f -s ../init.d/pdnsd S78pdnsd</code> in that dir)<br>
		
	  Then go to <code>/etc/rc.d/rc0.d</code> and create there the following symlink:<br>
	  K78pdnsd -> ../init.d/pdnsd 
	  (do <code>ln -f -s ../init.d/pdnsd K78pdnsd</code> in that dir)<br>
		
	  Then go to /etc/rc.d/rc6.d and create there the following symlink:<br>
	  K78pdnsd -> ../init.d/pdnsd 
	  (do <code>ln -f -s ../init.d/pdnsd K78pdnsd</code> in that dir)
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    This script is also covered by license stated in <a href="COPYING">COPYING</a>.
    Again, there is NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND on these scripts.
    This is no offical Redhat script, and Redhat naturally does NO support
    for it
    <br>
    <h3>0.5 Notes for FreeBSD users</h3>
    The special handling of ISDN ppp devices is only supported on Linux. It is not needed in FreeBSD, the normal
    device handling also works fine with isdn4bsd devices.<br>
    When compiled for FreeBSD, pdnsd as a small RFC compatability issue: RFC2181 demands answers on dns querys
    to be sent with the same source address the query packet went to. In seldom cases, this will not be the case,
    because the kernel selects the source address dependig on the interface that was used for sending the answer.<br>
    Setting the source address currently does not work for IPv4. I have written a kernel patch that will provide an easy way
    to program this. We'll see if or when it gets commited.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>1 Invocation</h2>
    When invoking pdnsd, you can specify various options at the command line. Command line options
    always override config file options. The various <b>--noX</b> options are present to override
    config file options.
    <p>
      pdnsd <b>--help</b> (or <b>-h</b>) gives you an overview of the pdnsd command line options.
    </p>
    <p>
      pdnsd <b>--version</b> (or <b>-V</b> for short) prints licence and version information.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start pdnsd as background daemon, specifiy <b>--daemon</b> (or <b>-d</b> for short) on
      the command line. Diagnostic and error messages after the actual daemon start
      will be printed to the syslog instead of the console. <b>--nodaemon</b> will disable this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When starting pdnsd as a daemon, the <b>-p</b> option may be helpful: It writes the pid
      of the server process to the file of the name given as argument to this option. <br>
      Example: <code>pdnsd -d -p /var/run/pdnsd.pid</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to specify a configuration file other that /etc/pdnsd.conf, specify
      <b>-c</b> or <b>--config-file</b> on the command line, followed by a filename.
    </p>
    <p>
      If pdnsd was compiled with debugging options enabled, you may specify <b>-g</b> or
      <b>--debug</b> on the command line. This will cause extra diagnostic messages to be
      printed. When pdnsd runs in deamon mode, the messages will be written to the <code>pdnsd.debug</code>
      file in your cache directory. <b>--nodebug</b> disables debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
      pdnsd <b>-vn</b> sets the verbosity level of pdnsd. n may be a digit from 0 to 3,
      where 0 means normal operation, while 3 will most verbose. Example is <code>-v2</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The option <b>-s</b> or <b>--status</b> enables the status pipe. This is a named pipe in
      the server directory called <code>status</code>. You can read the server status by doing <br>
      <code>cat &lt;your cache directory&gt;/status</code>. <b>--nostatus</b> disables the status
      pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The option <b>-t</b> or <b>--notcp</b> disables the seldom needed TCP server thread, which may
      save you some resources. <b>--tcp</b> will enable it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the <b>-m</b> option, you can select the method pdnsd uses to query other name servers. Following
      methods are supported:<br>
      <b>-muo</b>: pdnsd will use UDP only. This is the fastest method, and should be supported by all name servers
      on the internt. <br>
      <b>-mto</b>: pdnsd will use TCP only. TCP queries usually take longer time than UDP queries, but are more secure
      against certain attacks, where an attacker tries to guess your query id and to send forged answers. TCP queries
      are not supported by some name servers.<br>
      <b>-mtu</b>: pdnsd will try to use TCP, and will fall back to UDP if its connection is refused.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>2 The configuration file</h2>
    This section describes the layout of the configuration file and the available
    configuration options.
    The default location of the file is <code>/etc/pdnsd.conf</code>. This may be changed
    with the -c command line option.
    An example pdnsd.conf comes with the pdnsd distribution in the docs directory
    and will be installed to <code>/etc/</code> by <code>make install</code>.
    
    <br>
    <h3>2.1 Layout</h3>
    The configuration file is divided into sections. Each section is prefixed with
    the section name and opening curlies ({) and closed with closing curlies (}).
    In each section, configuration options can be given in the form <br>
    <code>
      option_name=option_value;
    </code><br>
    Option value may be a string literal (enclosed in &quot;), a number or a constant.
    Constants are noted in the section description in &lt;&gt; signs, but are written
    in the file without these signs. Some options take more than one value; in this
    case, the values are separated with commas. <br>
    If you may supply one of a set of possible values to an option, this is noted
    in the documentation as <br>
    <code>(option1|option2|option3|...)</code><br>
    Comments may be onclosed in /* and */, nested comments are possible. If the 
    # sign or two slashes (//) appear in the configuration file, everything from 
    these signs to the end of the current line is regarded as a comment and ignored.<br>
    There are examples for nearly all options in the sample config file.
    <br>
    <h3>2.1.1 <code>global</code> Section</h3>
    The global section specifies parameters that affect the overall behaviour of the
    server. If you specify multiple global sections, the settings of those later in
    the file will overwrite the earlier given values.<br>
    These are the possible options:<br><br>
    <table width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=10>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>perm_cache=(number|&lt;off&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  Switch the disk cache off or supply a maximum cache size in kB. If the disk 
	  cache is switched off, 4 bytes will still be written to disk.
	  The memory cache is always 10kB larger than the file cache.
	  This value is 2048 (2 MB) by default.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>cache_dir=string;</code></b><br>
	  Set the directory you want to keep the cache in.
	  The default is <code>&quot;/var/cache/pdnsd&quot;</code>.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>server_port=number;</code></b><br>
	  Set the server port. This is especially useful when you want to start the
	  server and are not root. Note that you may also not specify uptest=ping in
	  the server section as non-root.<br>
	  The default port is 53, the RFC-standard one. Note that you should only use 
	  non-standard ports when you only need clients on your machine to communicate
	  with the server; others will probably fail if the try to contact the server
	  on the basis of an NS record, since the A record that supplies the address for
	  (among others) name servers does not have a port number specification.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
 	<td>
	  <b><code>server_ip=string;</code></b><br>
	  Set the ip address pdnsd listens on for requests. This can be useful
          when the host has several interfaces and you want pdnsd not to listen on
          all interfaces. Addtionally, it is possibly to bind pdnsd to listen on
          127.0.0.2 to allow pdnsd to be a forwarder for BIND.
	  pdnsd will listen on all of your local interfaces by default. The ip
	  is treated as string and therefore needs to have quotation marks around it.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>linkdown_kluge=(&lt;on&gt;|&lt;off&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  This option enables a kluge that some people might need: when all servers are
	  marked down, with this option set the cache is not even used when a query is
	  received, and a DNS error is returned in any case. The only exception from this
	  is that local records (as specified in <code>rr</code> and <code>source</code>
	  sections are still served normally.
	  In general, you probably want to get cached entries even when the network is down, 
	  so this defaults to off.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>max_ttl=number;</code></b><br>
	  This options sets the maximum time a record is hold in cache in seconds. All dns 
	  resource records have a time to live field that says for what period of time the
	  record may be cached before it needs to be requeried. If this is more than the
	  value given with <code>max_ttl</code>, this time to live value is set to <code>max_ttl</code>.
	  This is done to prevent records from being cached an inappropriate long period of time, because
	  that is almost never a good thing to do. Default is 604800s (one week).
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>min_ttl=number;</code></b><br>
	  This options sets the minimum time a record is hold in cache in seconds. All dns 
	  resource records have a time to live field that says for what period of time the
	  record may be cached before it needs to be requeried. If this is less than the
	  value given with <code>min_ttl</code>, this time to live value is set to <code>min_ttl</code>.
	  Default is 120 seconds.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>neg_ttl=number;</code></b><br>
	  This option sets the time that negative cached records will remain valid in the
	  cache if no time to live can be determined. This is always the case when whole
	  domains are being cached negative, and additionally when record types are cached
	  negative for a domain for which no SOA record is known to pdnsd. If a SOA is present,
	  the ttl of the SOA is taken.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>neg_rrs_pol=(&lt;on&gt;|&lt;off&gt;|&lt;auth&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  This sets the RR set policy for negative cacheing; this tells pdnsd under which circumstances
	  it should cache a record type negative for a certain domain. <code>off</code> will
	  turn the negative cacheing of record types off, <code>on</code> will always add a negative
	  cache entry when a name server did not return a record type we asked it for, and <code>auth</code>
	  will only add such entries if the answer came from an authoritative name server for that
	  domain. The preset is <code>auth</code>. This is normally the right thing, as some cacheing servers
	  behave strange.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>neg_domain_pol=(&lt;on&gt;|&lt;off&gt;|&lt;auth&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  This is analogue to <code>neg_rrs_pol</code> for whole domain negative cacheing. The preset
	  is <code>on</code> here, because I have not seen a cacheing server that will falsely claim that a
	  domain does not exist. If you experience problems with false negatives, try setting this
	  to <code>auth</code>.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>run_as=string;</code></b><br>
	  This option allows you to let pdnsd change its user and group id after operations that needed
	  privileges have been done. This helps minimize security risks and is therefore recommended. The
	  supplied string gives a user name whose user id and primary group id are taken. <br>
	  A little more details: after reading the config file, becoming a daemon (if specified) and starting
	  the server status thread, the main thread changes its gid and uid, as do all newly created threads
	  thereafter. By taking another uid and gid, those threads run with the privileges of the
	  specified user. 
	  Under Linux and FreeBSD, the server status thread runs with the original privileges only when the strict_setuid option
	  is set to <code>off</code> (see below, <code>on</code> by default), because these may be needed
	  for exec uptests. The manager thread also retains its original privileges in this case.
	  You should take care that the user you specify has write permissions on your cache file and
	  status pipe (if you need a status pipe). You should look out for error messages like &quot;permission denied&quot;
	  and &quot;operation not permitted&quot; to discover permission problems.<br>
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>strict_setuid=(&lt;on&gt;|&lt;off&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  When used together with the <code>run_as</code> option, this option lets you specify that all threads of the
	  program will run with the privileges of the <code>run_as</code> user. This provides higher security than 
	  the normal run_as
	  option, but is not always possible. See the <code>run_as</code> option for further discussion.<br>
	  This option is on by default.<br>
	  Note that this option has no effect on Non-Linux systems.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>paranoid=(&lt;on&gt;|&lt;off&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  Normally, pdnsd queries all servers in recursive mode (i.e. instructs servers to query other servers themselves 
	  if possible,
	  and to give back answers for domains that may not be in its authority), and accepts additional records with information
	  for servers that are not in the authority of the queried server. This opens the possibility of so-called cache poisoning:
	  a malicious attacker might set up a dns server that, when queried, returns forged additional records. This way, he might
	  replace trusted servers with his own ones by making your dns server return bad IP addresses. This option protects 
	  you from cache poisoning by rejecting additional records
	  that do not describe domains in the queried servers authority space and not doing recursive queries any more. 
	  An exception
	  to this rule are the servers you specify in your config file, which are trusted.<br>
	  The penalty is a possible performance decrease, in particular, more queries might be necessary for the same 
	  operation.<br>
	  You should also notice that there may be other similar security problems, which are essentially problems of 
	  the DNS, i.e.
	  any &quot;traditional&quot; server has them (the DNS security extensions solve these problems, but are not widely 
	  supported).
	  One of this vulnerabilities is that an attacker may bombard you with forged answers in hopes that one may match a 
	  query
	  you have done. If you have done such a query, one in 65536 forged packets will be succesful (i.e. an average packet
	  count of 32768 is needed for that attack). pdnsd can use TCP for queries,
	  which has a slightly higher overhead, but is much less vulnerable to such attacks on sane operating systems. Also, pdnsd
	  chooses random query ids, so that an attacker cannot take a shortcut. If the attacker is able to listen to your network
	  traffic, this attack is relatively easy, though.<br>
	  This vulnerability is not pdnsd's fault, and is possible using any conventional
	  name server (pdnsd is perhaps a little more secured against this type of attacks if you make it use TCP).<br>
	  The <code>paranoid</code> option is off by default.<br>

	  In addition to normal uptests, you may specify that some servers shall only be queried when a certain

	  <b><code> uptest=(&lt;ping&gt;|&lt;none&gt;|&lt;if&gt;);</code></b><br>
	  Determine the method to check whether the server is available. Currently
	  defined methods are:

	  <ul>
	    <li><b><code>ping</code></b>: Send an ICMP_ECHO request to the server. If it doesn't respond
	      in timeout, it is regarded to be unavailable until the next probe.
	    <li> <b><code>none</code></b>: The server is p.d. up
	    <li> <b><code>if</code></b>: Check whether the interface (specified in the <code>interface=</code> option) is
	      existent, up and running. This currently works for all &quot;ordinary&quot;
	      network interfaces, interfaces that disappear when down (eg ppp?),
	      and additionally for Linux isdn interfaces (as of kernel 2.2). Note that
	      you need a <code>/dev/isdninfo</code> device file (major#45, minor#255), or the
	      isdn uptest will always fail.
	    <li><b><code>dev</code></b> and <b><code>diald</code></b>: Perform an <code>if</code> uptest, and, if that
	      was succesful, additionally check whether a program is running that
	      has locked a given (modem-) device. The needed parameters are an interface (specified as for the <code>if</code>
	      uptest, e.g. <code>&quot;ppp0&quot;</code>) and a device relative to <code>/dev</code> (e.g. 
	      <code>&quot;modem&quot;</code> for <code>/dev/modem</code> specified using the <code>device=</code> option.
	      pdnsd will then look for a pid file for the given interface in <code>/var/lock</code> (e.g. 
	      <code>/var/run/ppp0.pid</code>) and for a lockfile for the given device (e.g. <code>/var/lock/LCK..modem</code>),
	      and then test whether the locking process is the process that created the pid file and this process is still
	      alive. If this is the case, the normal <code>if</code> uptest is executed for the given interface.<br>
	      The <code>dev</code> option is for pppd dial-on-demand, <code>diald</code> is the same for diald users.
	    <li> <b><code>exec</code></b>: Executes a given command in the <code>/bin/sh</code> shell 
	      (as <code>/bin/sh -c &lt;command&gt;</code>)
	      and evaluates the result (the retur code of the last command) in the shell's way of handling return codes,
	      i.e. 0 indicates success, all other indicate failure. The shell's process name will be
	      <code>uptest_sh</code>. The command is given with the <code>uptest_cmd</code> option (see below).
	      For secuity issues, also see that entry.

	  interfaces (diald/pppd or ippp) to dial on dns queries. It is intended to be
	  used in connection with a interface testing uptest ;-) <br>
	  Note that using uptest=exec, you might run into performance problems
	  on slow machines when you use that option.
	  DON'T use this option with ping, as it may cause delays if the server
	  does not answer (btw, it doesn't make sense anyway).
	  Note also that using that option is no guarantee that the interface
	  will not be used. When another (reachable) dns server tells pdnsd
	  to query a third dns server for data, pdnsd will do that and has 
	  no means of checking whether this will dial up the interface or not.
	  This however should be a rare configuration.

    This option is intended to allow you to define RRs for 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.
    and localhost. (and perhaps even one or two hosts) without having to start an
    extra named if your cached name servers do not serve those records.

	<td>
	  <b><code>authrec=(on|off);</code></b><br>
	  If this is turned on, pdnsd will create authoritative local records for this rr section.
	  This means that pdnsd flags the domain record so that records of this domain that are not
	  present in the cache are treated as non-existent, i.e. no other servers are queried for
	  that record type, and an response containing none of those records is returned. This is
	  most time what people want: if you add an A record for a host, and it has no AAAA record
	  (and no IPv6 address), you normally don't want other name servers to be queried for it.<br>
	  This is on by default.<br>
	  Please note that this only has an effect if it precedes the name and owner options!
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>a=string;</code></b><br>
	  Defines an A (host address) record. The argument is an IP in dotted notation. pdnsd will serve
	  this adrress for the hostname given in the name option.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>ptr=string;</code></b><br>
	  Defines a PTR (domain name pointer) record. The argument is a host name in 
	  dotted notation (see name). The ptr record is for resolving adresses into names. For example, if
	  you want to have the adress 127.0.0.1 into localhost, and localhost into 127.0.0.1, you need something 
	  like the following sections:<br>
	  <code>
	    rr {<br>
	    owner=&quot;localhost.&quot;;<br>
	    name=&quot;localhost.&quot;;<br>
	    a=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;<br>
	    soa=&quot;localhost.&quot;,&quot;root.localhost.&quot;,42,86400,900,86400,86400;<br>
	    }<br>
	    rr {<br>
	    owner=&quot;localhost.&quot;;<br>
	    name=&quot;1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.&quot;;<br>
	    ptr=&quot;localhost.&quot;;<br>
	    soa=&quot;localhost.&quot;,&quot;root.localhost.&quot;,42,86400,900,86400,86400;<br>
	    }<br>
	  </code>
	  The second section is for reverse resolving and uses the ptr option. There is something special
	  about the name in the second section: when a resolver wants to get a hostname from an internet
	  address, it composes an adress that is build of the IP address in reverse byte order 
	  (<code>1.0.0.127</code> instead of <code>127.0.0.1</code>) where each byte of the adress written 
	  as number constitutes a sub-domain under the domain <code>in-addr.arpa.</code> <br>
	  So, if you want to compose an adress for reverse resolving, take your ip in dotted notation (eg <code>1.2.3.4</code>),
	  reverse the byte order (<code>4.3.2.1</code>) and append in-addr.arpa. (<code>4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.</code>) 
	  Then, define an <code>rr</code> section giving this address as <code>name</code> and the domain name corresponding to
	  that ip in the <code>ptr</code> option.
	</td>

      <tr>
	<td>
	  <b><code>soa=string,string,number,number,number,number,number;</code></b><br>
	  This defines a soa (record source information) record. The first string is the

	  owner. <br>
	  The second string specifies the email address of the maintainer of the name 
	  server. It is also specified as a domain name, so you will have to replace the 
	  @ sign in the name with a dot (.) to get the name you have to specify here.
	  The next parameter (the first number) is the serial number of the record. You 
	  should increment this number if you change the record.<br>
	  The 4th parameter (the 2nd number) is the refresh timeout. It specifies after 
	  what amount of time a caching server should attempt to refresh the cached 
	  record.<br>
	  The 5th parameter specifies a time after which a caching server should attempt 
	  to refresh the record after a refresh failure.<br>
	  The 6th parameter defines the timeout after which a cached record expires if it
	  has not been refreshed.<br>
	  The 7th parameter is the ttl that is specified in every rr and should be the 
	  same as given with the ttl option (if you do not specify a ttl, use the default 86400)<br>

    <h3>2.1.4 <code>neg</code> Section</h3>
    Every neg section specifies a dns resource record or a dns domainthat should be 
    cached negative locally. Queries for negatively cached records are always answered
    immediatley with an error or an empty answer without querying other hosts as long
    as the record is valid. The record remains valid until it is explicitely invalidated
    or deleted by the user using pdnsd-ctl.<br>
    This is useful if a certian application asks periodically for nonexisting hosts or
    RR types and you do not want a query to go out every time the cached record has
    timed out. Example: Netscape Communicator will ask for the servers  news and mail
    on startup if unconfigured. If you do not have a dns search list for your network,
    you can inhibit outgoing queries for these by specifying<br>
    <code>
    neg {<br>
    name=&quot;news.&quot;;<br>
    types=domain;<br>
    }<br>
    neg {<br>
    name=&quot;mail.&quot;;<br>
    types=domain;<br>
    }<br>

	<td>
	  <b><code>types=(&lt;domain&gt;|rr_type[,rr_type[,rr_type[,...]]]);</code></b><br>

	  domain negatively; alternatively, you can specify a comma-separated list of RR types 
	  which are to be cached negatively. You may specify multiple types options, but
	  <code>domain</code> and the RR types are mutually exclusive.<br>
	  The RR types are specified using their official names from the RFC's in capitals,
	  e.g. <code>A</code>, <code>CNAME</code>, <code>NS</code>, <code>PTR</code>, <code>MX</code>, 
	  <code>AAAA</code>, ...<br>
	  The command <code>pdnsd-ctl list-rrtypes</code> will give you a complete list

    <h3>2.1.5 <code>source</code> Section</h3>
    Every source section allows you to let pdnsd read the records from a file in an
    <code>/etc/hosts</code>-like format. pdnsd will generate records to resolve the entries 
    address from its host name and vice versa for every entry in the file. This is 
    normally easier than defining an rr for every of your addresses, since localhost
    and your other FQDNs are normally given in <code>/etc/hosts</code>.<br>
    The accepted format is as follows: The #-sign initiates a comment, the rest of 
    the line from the first occurence of this character on is ignored. Empty lines 
    are tolerated.<br>
    The first entry on a line (predeceded by an arbitrary number of tabs and spaces)
    is the IP in dotted notation, the second entry on one line (separated by the 
    first by an arbitrary number of tabs and spaces) is the FQDN (fully qualified 
    domain name) for that ip. The rest of the line is ignored (in the original 
    <code>/etc/hosts</code>, it may contain information not needed by pdnsd).

    <h2>3 pdnsd-ctl</h2>
    pdnsd-ctl allows you to run-time configure pdnsd. To make this work, you have to start pdnsd with the <code>-s</code>
    option (or use the <code>status_ctl</code> option in the config file). You also should make sure that you
    have appropriate permissions on the control socket (use the <code>ctl_perms</code> option to make this sure) and of your pdnsd
    cache directory (pdnsd keeps it's socket there). Please make sure the pdnsd cache directory is not writeable for untrusted users!<br>
    pdnsd-ctl takes one optional command line argument, <code>-c</code>. It is used to specify the cache directory (and takes this as argument).
    The default for this settings is the pdnsd default cache directory (specified at compile time). The cache directory for pdnsd-ctl must
    be the same pdnsd uses!<br>
    The following table lists the command line options that pdnsd-ctl supports. The command must always be

	  Add a record of the given type to the pdnsd cache, replacing existing
	  records for the same <i>name</i> and type. The 2nd argument corresponds
	  to the argument of the option in the rr section that is named like
	  the first option: a is a record for hostname-to-address mapping,
	  aaaa is the same thing for IPv6 addresses, and ptr is for address-to-hostname
	  mapping. See the documentation for the <code>rr</code> section for more details.
	  The <i>ttl</i> is optional, the default is 900 seconds.
	  <code>noauth</code> is used to make the domains non-authoritative - please see
	  the description of the <code>authrec</code> config file options for a description of what
	  that means.
	  If you want no other record than the newly added in the cache, do<br>
	  <code>pdnsdctl record <i>name</i> delete</code>
	  before adding records. This is also better when overwriting local records. Example:<br>
	  <code>pdnsd-ctl add a 127.0.0.1 localhost. 900</code>

	Add a negative cached record to pdnsd's cache, replacing existing
	records for the same <i>name</i> and <i>type</i>. If no type is given, the whole
	domain is cached negative. For negative cached records, errors are
	immediately returned on a query, without querying other servers first.
	The <i>ttl</i> is optional, the default is 900 seconds. <br>
	You can get a list of all types you can pass to this command using
	<code>pdnsd-ctl list-rrtypes</code>. The type is treated case-sensitive!
	Example:<br>
	<code>pdnsd-ctl neg foo.bar A 900</code><br>
	<code>pdnsd-ctl neg foo.baz 900</code><br>

    <h2>4 contrib/</h2>
    The contrib directory in the pdnsd distribution contains useful user-contributed scripts.<br>
    So far, there is a script contributed by Marko Stolle that makes pdnsd usable in a DHCP setup.
    Please take a look into the README file in the contrib directory for further information.
