Version 0.9.4 was the first to be released to the public. For information on 
changes, see ChangeLog.

Version 0.9.5 introduces uptest=exec, and a modified config file syntax (cache
sizes are now specified in kB).

The versions 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 are bugfix releases.

Version 0.9.8 fixes a minor bug some build problems with glibc2.0 systems.

When compiling versions after 0.9.8, you will probably get more compiler warnings
than before. This is because the C compiler settings have been made stricter.

Version 0.9.9 contains the rc scripts for Red Hat Linux contributed by Torben 
Janssen, in addition to code cleanups and bugfixes.
The meaning of the option -v has changed in this release.
There is also a new config file option "lean_query" that is on by default. It 
is an optimization, so please look in the docs when updating whether you want 
it switched on or not.

Version 0.9.10 fixes some bugs and improves build on Red Hat.

Version 0.9.11 fixes a security hole. Please see ChangeLog for details.

Version 1.0.0 has a lot of changes compared to the 0.9.x tree, but much of 
them "under the hood":
- IPv6 support (experimental; compile- and run-time configurable)
- FreeBSD (and such hopefully *BSD) support
- better rfc2181 compatability
- new options:
  - serve_aliases in source section
  - linkdown_kluge in global section 
  - max_ttl in global section 
- cache-code reorganization, only one unified hash (of variable depth)
- Optimizations & cleanups
- Automatic deps (only interesting for developers ;-)

Versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 are bugfix releases.

Version 1.0.4 introduces the new options run_as, strict_setuid and
paranoid. These new options are optional security enhancements.
