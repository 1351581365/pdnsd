There is some part of the documentation in doc/txt/manual.txt and 
/doc/html/doc.html that is intended to make hacking on pdnsd easier.

However, here are a few notes and rationales on how things were
done, sometimes concerning coding style:

* use of sizeof - I quite often use sizeof not on the variables, but
  on types instead. This is considered unsafe by some, but some 
  facts special to pdnsd make it seem more appropriate: I most times
  do this on answer buffers or on other buffers that are of special
  types. While the type of the buffer may be the type of the pointer,
  this is not guaranteed, mostly because those buffers usually use
  the given type only as header and have other data following. Thus,
  a change of the pointer type is much more likely than a change of
  the header type, and using sizeof(*pointer) is much more error
  prone than using sizeof(pointer_type). All such structures are typedefed
  and the type is always used, so there is one central place to change
  them all.
  Regardless which sizeof convention you use in the code, you will
  have to watch your step anyway. Often, these buffers are needed,
  though, and sometimes they are just convenient to use ;-)

* use of constants for string lengths - Again an issue some conisder
  unsafe, but often string buffers have additional space I do not
  want to be filled. 90% of these constants are things like the
  maximum dns name length that won't change.
  However, I agree that on that changing this may be sensible some
  day ;-)
