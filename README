You can find the documentation for pdnsd in the doc/ directory. The html
documentation (which I recommend) is in the doc/html/ subdirectory.
The pure text documentation (which is generated automatically from the 
html documentation) is in doc/txt/.
The following documents are available:

index.html / index.txt		Overview, system requirements
doc.html / doc.txt		Building, installation and usage instructions
faq.html / faq.txt		The FAQ

Share and enjoy!
