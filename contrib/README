This directory contains user-contributed scripts for use with pdnsd.
So far there are:

pdnsd_update.pl
	A perl script contributed by Marko Stolle (derived from a script by
	Mike Stella) to watch a ISC DHCPD leases file and add local records for
	the hosts listed there. This makes pdnsd useable in a DHCP setup.
	Please look into the script for usage instructions (you will probably
	also need to customize som settings there).
