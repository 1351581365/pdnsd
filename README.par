	  Alternative pdnsd implementation - version 1.1.7a-par
	  ======================================================

This file describes the customized version of pdnsd that I use personally and am
making available so other people can run it and/or study the source code.
Present version is 1.1.7a-par (I've simply appended my initials to the version
number). The first part of this file describes how to patch, compile, install
and run pdnsd. The second part describes some of the changes I've made to Thomas
Moestl's code.

Before compiling and installing pdnsd according to Thomas Moestl's instructions
described in the INSTALL file you must first apply my patch file
pdnsd-1.1.7a-par.diff.gz using the command:

gzip -cd <path_to_patch>/pdnsd-1.1.7a-par.diff.gz | patch -p2 -N -E

Note: because I have used GNU extensions you will need to compile with gcc and
link with glibc. This will not be a problem with most Linux distributions.

That's it! You should now be able to compile, install and run pdnsd.

The rest of this file describes some modifications I've made, but you don't have
to read it if you simply want to run pdnsd as you're used to.


- The main new feature I've added enables you to change the server addresses
  that pdnsd uses at run-time using pdnsd-ctl. I've done this because the ISPs I
  use do not specify fixed DNS server addresses, but expect their clients to use
  dynamic DNS configuration (DHCP in the case of the cable connection, RFC1877
  in case of isdn). I've extended the options that can be given with the
  "server" command to pdnsd-ctl, to allow IP addresses to be specified as an
  additional argument after "up|down|retest". This allows me to put something
  like this in my ifup-local script:

  pdnsd-ctl server isp-label up $DNS1,$DNS2

  This was quite tricky to implement because there might be pending queries
  while the addresses are being changed. It certainly was an interesting
  exercise in writing multi-threaded code for me.


- I've implemented a feature which allowed me to specify multiple IP addresses
  per server section in the configuration file. This allowed for a much more
  compact configuration file (3 server sections instead of 7 in my case),
  because most configuration options are identical for servers belonging to the
  same ISP. It also made the output of "pdnsd-ctl status" more compact. And it
  was necessary to enable a satisfactory implementation of the previous feature.

- I've changed the implementation of dynamic arrays to make it slightly more
  efficient, and improve type safety. I also got rid of several arrays of fixed
  size in favor of dynamically allocated arrays. In particular, I got rid of
  all occurrences of MAXPATH. I also made several static variables "automatic".

- The output of the "status" command of pdnsd-ctl now gives more meaningful
  constant names "ping|none|if|exec" instead of numbers for the "uptest" option.

- I've fixed I a problem that caused pdnsd to use up a lot of CPU time and slow
  down my system considerably when it received a query that took a long time to
  resolve. It turned out that pdnsd can get into a "busy loop" when one of the
  DNS servers pdnsd is querying refuses the connection. Apart from fixing this
  bug, to speed things up additionally, I thought it would be a good idea to
  mark a server down (without retesting it) after detecting errno==ECONNREFUSED.
  This gives me very satisfactory performance, with the problematic server being
  tried only once during every testing interval.

- Due to a bug in Thomas' code, pdnsd tries, but fails, to remove the control
  socket "pdnsd.status" before exiting. This has also been fixed.

- I've rewritten some of the code that saves the contents of the cache to the
  file "pdnsd.cache" just before pdnsd exits. This is because I noticed in my
  logfiles that pdnsd occasionally had problems reading this file back at
  startup. I eliminated the use of fseek() in Thomas' code. I could not find
  anything that was demonstrably incorrect about his use of fseek(), but it
  seemed better to me to do without it and write the file in a strictly
  sequential order. Anyway, it turned out my hunch paid off: no more error
  messages about "pdnsd.cache" in my logfile.

In addition to the things I've listed above, I've made various little changes to
fix minor bugs, improve efficiency or elegance, or simply to suit my my own
coding style. These changes are too numerous to list here, but you can always
find out about them by comparing the source of my modified version with Thomas'
original code.

If you have any questions about the modifications I've made, you can send these

be sent to <tmoestl@gmx.net> or <t.moestl@tu-bs.de>.
